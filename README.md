# Tessellator mesher

## Features

Tessellator is a mesher focused on generate meshes and data structures which are suitable for FDTD algorithms. It includes the following capabilities:

- Generate staircased meshes from lines, surfaces, and volumes.
- Support for rectilinear (graded) grids.
- Import/Export in STL or VTK formats.
- Conflict resolution between different layers using a predefined hierarchy.
- Generate conformal meshes with fixed distance intersection with grid planes.

## Compilation

When using presets, make sure to define the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` to your `vcpkg` installation.
